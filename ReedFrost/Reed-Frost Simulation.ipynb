    "The Reed-Frost model is a simple epidemiologic model in which each individual in a population takes one of three possible states: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). At each time step, every infected (I) individual has some probability p of coming into contact with each susceptible (S) person, independently of the others. If a susceptible individual comes into contact with at least one infected individual, they will become infected for the next time step and recovered (R) the time step after that. As such, each infected individual is only infected for one time step and cannot be re-infected after they reach \"recovered\" status. \n",

    "- size: the total number of people in the population\n",
    "- I0: the initial number of infected individuals (the rest of the population will start as susceptible)\n",
    "- p: the probability of contact between each infected and susceptible individual\n",
